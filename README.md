# Editing Code

If you wish to edit any code, do so in the **code-test** branch, **_not_** the **master** branch. Also, do so in the form of a Pull Request, so that any chances may be vetted before being applied.

# Issues

If you discover any bugs in the code, or issues that need to be resolved, please log them in the **Issues** tab for everyone to see.

# To Do List

The **Projects** tab contains a Trello-like board with three coloumns: To Do, Doing and Done. Please add to and update this as needed.
